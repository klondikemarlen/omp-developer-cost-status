## [Unreleased]

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-26

### Changed

- Scope the 0.8 preview spec to prompt-driven, single-session developer cost tracking.
- Treat multi-session spread billing as a planned later enhancement.

### Fixed

- Replace filesystem-based child-session detection with OMP session header metadata.
- Surface malformed or unreadable plugin config files instead of silently falling back to defaults.
- Restore persisted developer cost from the full session history so branch changes do not hide prior meter state.

### Added

- Package the canonical feature spec with release artifacts.
- Document the supported Node.js and OMP runtime contract.
- Add CI coverage for tests, typecheck, and package contents.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- Add prompt-driven developer-time cost tracking for OMP sessions.
- Add configurable salary, working-hours, active-window, refresh-interval, and label settings.
- Persist precise decimal cost state in session custom entries.
- Add tests for billing math, persisted state parsing, and config reload behavior.
